        <div>
            <h2 class="lionheading">Lion</h2>
            <div id="Lion">
                <ul class="lionfacts">
                    <li>In the wild, there are two formally recognised lion subspecies. The African lion (Panthera
                        leo
                        leo)
                        is
                        found
                        in Africa, south of the Sahara desert. The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in one
                        small
                        population around Gir Forest National Park in western India. Wild lions in the west and
                        central
                        Africa
                        are
                        more closely related to these Asiatic lions in India than to those found in southern and
                        east
                        Africa.
                    </li>
                    <li>On average, male lions weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20
                        stone).
                        They
                        need
                        this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride.</li>
                    <li>Young lions have rosettes and spots on their sandy coats, but these generally disappear as
                        they
                        mature.
                    </li>
                    <li>Male lions grow impressive manes the older they get. These manes grow up to 16cm long and
                        are a
                        sign
                        of
                        dominance. The older they get, the darker their manes go. As well as attracting females,
                        their
                        manes
                        may
                        also protect their neck and head from injuries during fights.</li>

                    alt="polar_bear">
                <ul class="bearfacts">
                    <li>Because they spend most of their lives on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean depending on the
                        ocean
                        for
                        their
                        food and habitat, polar bears are the only bear species to be considered marine mammals.
                    </li>
                    <li>Beneath all that thick fur, polar bears have jet black skin. The polar bear’s fur is also
                        translucent,
                        and
                        only appears white because it reflects visible light.</li>
                    <li>As well as reaching speeds of up to 6mph in the water, polar bears can swim for long
                        distances
                        and
                        steadily
                        for many hours to get from one piece of ice to another. Their large paws are specially
                        adapted
                        for
                        swimming,
                        which they’ll use to paddle through the water while holding their hind legs flat like a
                        rudder.
                    </li>
                    <li>Although about half of a polar bear’s life is spent hunting for food, their hunts are rarely
                        successful.
                        A
                        polar bear’s main prey consists of ringed seals and bearded seals, which they hunt in a
                        variety
                        of
                        ways.
                        Either by breaking into pupping dens, waiting at breathing holes or at the water’s edge, or
                        stalking
                        seals
                        that have hauled out to rest on the ice. Besides catching seals, polar bears will also
                        scavenge
                        carcasses or
                        settle for small mammals, birds, eggs and vegetation.</li>

            <h2 class="sharkheading">Sharks</h2>
            <div id="Shark">
                <ul class="sharkfacts">
                    <li>143 of these are under threat, listed by IUCN from vulnerable to critically endangered.</li>
                    <li>Many have several rows of teeth and can lose and replace thousands of teeth in their
                        lifetimes.
                        As
                        predators, sharks play a vital role in the health of marine ecosystems - by eating fish they
                        help
                        create
                        balance in the food chain.</li>
                    <li>From the smallest dwarf lantern shark (which is about the size of a human hand), to the
                        largest
                        which
                        can be
                        up to 12 metres long - the whale shark.</li>
                    <li>They can be found in beautiful, tropical coral reefs, to the deep sea, and even under the
                        Arctic
                        sea
                        ice.

            <h2 class="koalaheading">Koala</h2>
            <div id="koala">
                <img class="koalaimg"
                    src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556811431-ec33c663aa89?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=870&q=80"
                    alt="koala">
                <ul class="koalafacts">
                    <li>The word "koala" is thought to originate from one of the Australian Aboriginal languages,
                        Dharug,
                        which
                        roughly translates to ‘no drink’ or ‘no water’. And this might explain why. In the
                        Australian
                        bush,
                        koalas
                        rarely drink water as the majority of their water intake comes from eating fresh eucalyptus
                        leaves.
                        Koalas
                        drinking water is uncommon in the wild, although they can do so if necessary, especially
                        during
                        heat
                        waves,
                        droughts or bushfires.</li>
                    <li>Koalas are folivore specialists, feeding mainly on Eucalyptus leaves, and occasional leaves
                        of
                        other
                        plant
                        species. The koala’s digestive system is particularly good at tolerating its toxic
                        eucalyptus
                        diet,
                        which,
                        even in small amounts, can often be poisonous and fatal to most animals when ingested.
                        Special
                        liver
                        enzymes
                        and symbiotic gut bacteria help to break down poisonous compounds, thus allowing koalas to
                        survive
                        on a
                        diet
                        of eucalyptus leaves. They can eat up to a kilogram a day without even breaking a sweat!
                    </li>
                    <li>70% of Australia is either arid or semi-arid land, since the continent receives so little
                        rain.
                        Hence,
                        most
                        of the country’s unique wildlife has had to adapt to living in dry environments, including
                        koalas.
                        Koalas
                        are endemic to Australia, where they can only be found in the southeast and eastern parts of
                        the
                        country,
                        along the coastlines of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. They
                        live in
                        forests
                        and
                        open woodlands, typically dominated by eucalyptus tree species. In inland areas, koalas can
                        be
                        found
                        living
                        in eucalyptus woodlands close to water sources such as streams and creeks.</li>
                    <li>There is only one species of Koala in the world. It is the only extant member of the family
                        Phascolarctidae,
                        whose closest living relatives are the common wombats. Their wild numbers are estimated to
                        be
                        around
                        300,000
                        mature individuals, but showing a declining population trend. Koalas are currently listed as
                        vulnerable
                        by
                        the IUCN.</li>
